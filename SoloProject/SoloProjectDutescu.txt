The project I will be developing features an Arduino board.
It will implement the idea of keycard entry systems.
The project uses: 
	-  Arduino MEGA 2560
	- 1 green LED
	- 1 red LED
	- 2 magnetic keycards
	- 1 RFID sensor for keycards
	- 1 LCD display
	- 1 matrix keypad
	- 1 breadboard
	- cables

The purpose of the project is to implement a system
similar to the keycard entry systems used to limit
access to unauthorized people.
The flow of the project is as follows:
We scan the keycard on the RFID sensor. We select an option from the menu
by using the matrix keypad. The options binded to the keypad are:
pressing button 1 - add a new keycard to the database, this keycard will provide access in the future
pressing button 2 - delete the scanned keycard from the database
pressing button 3 - try to get access ( check if the keycard has or does not have access)
When choosing option 3 there are 2 scenarios that can occur:
1. We have access, a green LED lights up and a message is shown on the LCD display
2. We do not have access, a red LED lights up and a message is shown on the LCD display

As future works, this project can surely be scaled and implemented to work in 
providing access for authorized people in certain areas. It would need an additional
internet source in order to connect it to a server and provide access in real-time based
on the data stored in the server database.
